# RobotReviewer
Automatic extraction of data from clinical trial reports

A simple webserver written in Python which accepts a clinical trial (in plain text/JSON), and returns risk of bias judgements.

## Dependencies

RobotReviewer requires the following libraries:

    sklearn
    numpy
    scipy
    hickle
    nltk

`nltk` and `sklearn` are not used much, and will be removed in time

## Running

`python robot.py` will start a flask server running on `localhost:5000`. You can run the server in development mode by passing `DEBUG=true python robot.py` which will attempt live code reload.

## Running the Web UI
The optional web interface is provided by [Vortext](https://github.com/vortext/spa) [Sp√°](https://github.com/vortext/spa).
It can be installed by running the following commands:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd static/scripts/spa/pdfjs
npm install
node make generic
cd -
python robot.py
```

This retrieves the front-end code and compiles pdf.js; and runs the server.

## Input/output

Send some JSON by POST to /annotate such as:

    {
        "text": "Put the full text of a clinical trial in here"
    }

and it will return something like:

    {
       'domain':'Random sequence generation',
       'justification':[
          u'They were randomly assigned,
          in a double-blind manner,
          to receive a bolus and infusion of either eptifibatide or placebo,
          in addition to standard therapy,
          for up to 72 hours (or up to 96 hours,
          if coronary intervention was performed near the end of the 72-hour period).',

       'bias level':'LOW'
    }
